Auto boxing is when ints are automatically converted to Integer objects and because of that, there can be problems when you use == to compare two ints... or maybe an int and an Integer. Well what is happening here is that auto boxing uses Integer.valueOf() method which converts Integer to int when you compare two Integer objects in the range of -128 to 127. Outside of that range, it can cause bugs. Like what is happening to our code once we hit 128 which is outside the range.
